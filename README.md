# GitHub Actions Tutorial: Automating CI/CD Workflows

This repository contains the implementation of a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, following a 
TechWorld with Nana tutorial that demonstrates the power of automation in modern software development.

## 🚀 Overview
GitHub Actions is a tool for automating developer workflows directly within your GitHub repository. It allows you to build, test, and deploy your code efficiently while leveraging GitHub's ecosystem.

### Key Concepts Covered:
1. **What is GitHub Actions?**
   - An overview of its purpose and benefits.
   - Examples of use cases for workflow automation.

2. **Core Components of GitHub Actions:**
   - **Events:** Triggers for workflows (e.g., `push`, `pull_request`, `schedule`).
   - **Actions:** Steps within a workflow (e.g., build, test, deploy).
   - **Workflows:** YAML files that define the sequence of actions.

3. **Why GitHub Actions for CI/CD?**
   - Integrated with your GitHub repository.
   - Simplifies the CI/CD process.
   - Supports custom workflows and reusable actions.

4. **Hands-on Demo:**
   - Building a CI pipeline for a **Java Gradle Project**.
   - Creating a Docker image.
   - Pushing the Docker image to a private DockerHub repository.

To follow along or replicate this project, you need:

1. A GitHub repository.
2. A DockerHub account with a private repository.
3. Knowledge of YAML syntax (for the workflow file).
4. A basic understanding of Gradle and Docker.
